//! WebGPU for HashLink.
//!
//! Natively this crate is `wgpu.hdll`: it holds the implementation and
//! the VM calls straight into it, so it loads in upstream HashLink too. Built
//! wasm it is `wgpu.wasm` and holds nothing -- a wasip1 module has no GPU and
//! no JavaScript, so the primitives forward to a host instead. `IMPORTS.md`
//! is what a host has to supply.
//!
//! Every side but the implementation comes from `wgpu.api`; see `build.rs`.

// wgpu's types nest deeply enough that proving `Slab<wgpu::Instance>: Send`
// overflows the default limit of 128.
#![recursion_limit = "256"]
